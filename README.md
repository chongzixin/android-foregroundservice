# android-foregroundservice
Simple app that writes timestamp to persistent storage every minute. I am trying to create an app that will stay alive without being subjected to Doze or Battery Optimisations from Chinese Phone Manufacturers.

# Data Analysis
A separate repo contains a notebook used to analyse the file created from this app. You can find the repo at https://github.com/chongzixin/android-foregroundservice-analysis-tool.
